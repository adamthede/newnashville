# The New Nashville Manifesto

Nashville has a problem. Despite it's recent growth and widespread acclaim, there is still an element of exclusivity (particularly among white, middle class males) that excludes minorities from participation. This serves as a public acknowledgement of that problem, and a rejection of the attitude that nothing can be done about it.

As participants of the local technology community, we agree to the following:

* Inclusiveness cannot taken for granted: efforts should be made to include minorities.
* Egos are not welcome.
* Code of Conduct should apply to all events. Python's is a good [starting point](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
